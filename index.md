## CryptoBlox ##

This is our first physical product (in a series) and is a 3d printed Lego-like block that has been designed to conceal your Ledger Nano S. It looks and acts just like a standard Lego block except It has a cavity to store you Ledger device on the underside.  

If you a 3D printing manufacturer or already sell crypto products we would love you to also sell this. 

We offer it for free under the MIT license and ask for a $1 license fee (payable via BTC or Lightning) for each unit sold. In the spirit of Bitcoin, this is a completely optional payment. You can choose to pay us more or nothing. However, if you do choose to pay the license fee this will allow us to continue to design and giveaway new products as well as fund our teaching and outreach efforts.

Please send funds (BTC) only to:

If you would like to pay by Lightning then please contact us via Twitter
